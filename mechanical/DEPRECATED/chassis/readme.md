### This folder contains all of the parts to create the chassis of Roversa for laser cutting

DXF 2D files for laser cutting and STEP 3D files for any CAD program etc

All parts in this folder must be cut out of **3mm stock material!** The plywood used in the main picture was sold as 3mm or 1/8" but measured an average of 2.88mm thick and was a tight fit. The accuracy of your laser and kerf will also be a factor when adjusting for tolerances. You will have a lot of trouble if your stock measures larger than 3.05mm.

`bottom` is the bottom piece of the chassis

`shelf` is the mid plane of the chassis

`wheelBase` is the part that holds the ball bearing assembly to the chassis

`side_x2` are the sides of the robot, they are identical, they can be mirrored so that the finish on the robot is similar, and you will need 2 of these - you can drill the holes that mount the servo motors out with a 1.60mm or 1/16" drill bit for the M2 screws

`servoSupport_x2` are the pieces that sit behind each servo motor to hold them square and securely in place, these are identical and you will need 2 of these

If you wish to laser cut multiple robots, we have provided a template to get you started. 

`roversaLaserCut2.1-logo-x4.svg` and `roversaLaserCut2.1-logo-x4.ai` will give you flatpack versions of the robot with 4 robots. These 4 will fit on on 300x600mm sheet of material.
