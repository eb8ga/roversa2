### This folder contains all of the parts for the mechanical components

The laser cut folder has all the pieces in DXF and STEP format. It also has files that accomodate 3mm and 1/8" stock (we found our tolerances at 3.2mm fit the 1/8" plywood well). 

The 3D Print folder has all the remaining parts, wheels, battery holder, bearing support, and the butttons for the keypad.
