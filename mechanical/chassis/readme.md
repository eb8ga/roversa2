### This folder contains all of the parts to create the chassis of Roversa for laser cutting

All parts in this folder must be cut out of **3mm stock material!** The plywood used in the main picture was sold as 3mm/1/8" but measures average 2.88mm thick and was a tight fit.

`bottom.dxf` is the bottom piece of the chassis

`shelf.dxf` is the mid plane of the chassis

`wheelBase.dxf` is the part that holds the ball bearing assembly to the chassis

`side_x2.dxf` are the sides of the robot, they are identical, they can be mirrored so that the finish on the robot is similar, and you will need 2 of these - you can drill the holes that mount the servo motors out with a 1.60mm or 1/16" drill bit for the M2 screws

`servoSupport_x2.dxf` are the pieces that sit behind each servo motor to hold them square and securely in place, these are identical and you will need 2 of these
